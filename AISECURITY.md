## 1. "AI Security: The Next Frontier" (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOmgoNIC7a0)
- AI security is now as critical as cybersecurity, with unique risks such as model theft, data poisoning, and prompt injection.
- Emphasizes the need for a new security mindset: AI systems are probabilistic, not deterministic.
- Key threats: adversarial attacks, model inversion, and supply chain vulnerabilities.
- Advocates for continuous red teaming and monitoring of AI systems in production.

## 2. "Securing AI: From Research to Reality" (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOwiu2gA4BY)
- Discusses the gap between academic research and real-world AI security deployments.
- Highlights the importance of robust evaluation, adversarial testing, and incident response plans for AI.
- Stresses the need for cross-functional teams (security, ML, compliance) to address AI risks.
- Introduces the concept of "AI Bill of Materials" for supply chain transparency.

## 3. "AI Risk Management: Practical Approaches" (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WpaFxTtlQ)
- Presents frameworks for AI risk assessment, including NIST AI RMF and OWASP Top 10 for LLMs.
- Recommends integrating risk management into the AI lifecycle: design, development, deployment, and monitoring.
- Key controls: input/output validation, access controls, and continuous monitoring.
- Encourages organizations to adopt a risk-based, layered defense strategy.

## 4. "Adversarial Attacks and Defenses in AI" (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dj1H4g4YSlU)
- Explains common adversarial attack types: evasion, poisoning, model extraction, and membership inference.
- Demonstrates real-world attack scenarios and their impact on AI model integrity and confidentiality.
- Reviews defense mechanisms: adversarial training, robust optimization, and anomaly detection.
- Stresses the importance of security-by-design and regular adversarial testing.

## 5. "AI Governance and Compliance" (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVAmhlUVEcg)
- Covers regulatory trends: EU AI Act, NIST, ISO/IEC 42001, and sector-specific guidelines.
- Discusses the role of governance boards, model documentation, and audit trails in AI compliance.
- Highlights the need for explainability, transparency, and human oversight in high-risk AI systems.
- Suggests regular compliance reviews and alignment with evolving standards.

## 6. "Building Secure and Trustworthy AI Systems" (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rhpqiunpu0c)
- Outlines best practices for secure AI development: threat modeling, secure coding, and privacy by design.
- Emphasizes the importance of data quality, provenance, and secure data pipelines.
- Recommends integrating security testing into CI/CD pipelines for AI.
- Advocates for a culture of security awareness and ongoing education for AI teams.
